# ADXL345_Library_for_arduino
cn->
一种简单方便的驱动库可以很好兼容arduino系列，更少的依赖方便移植到其他类型mcu，灵活配置寄存器

iicsensor ic传感器，这里包括adx345驱动和一个aht10的驱动 意味着他不能以spi方式操作。以后会加以改进。
这个库文件并不简洁。但是可读性非常高，主要弥补流行库文件不能涵盖的功能，例如低功耗，fifo。

A simple and convenient driver library can be well compatible with arduino series, less dependence easy to transplant to other types of MCU, flexible configuration register  
 
Iicsensor IC sensor, which includes adX345 driver and an AHT10 driver means it cannot operate in SPI mode.  It will be improved later.

This library file is not brief but very readable, mainly to make up for features not covered by popular library files, such as low power consumption, FIFO.
